        <p> <strong>CAUTION!</strong> <br> The spicy of the food will be defined by the amount of peppers and<br> chilli you use and if you remove the seeds and veins of the peppers and chilli, <br> so I recommend you to clean the better you can your peppers and chilli. <br><strong>CAUTION!</strong></p>
        
        <p>Let's checkout our ingredients:</p>

            <li><em>Four</em> <strong>guajillo</strong> chilli</li><br>
            <li><em>Four</em> <strong>Ancho</strong> chilli</li><br>
            <li><em>Two</em> chopped garlics</li><br>
            <li><em>A quarter spoon</em> of cilantro</li><br>
            <li><em>Salt and black pepper</em> spinach</li><br>
            <li><em>Twelve</em> tortillas (The bigger the better)</li><br>
            <li><em>Two</em> cups of shredded chicken or <em>pig</em></li><br>
            <li><em>One and half cup </em> of crumbled fresh cheese</li><br>
            <li><em>A half</em> of chopped onion</li> <br>
            <li><em>One third</em> of vegetable oil</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>If you want, you can make some potatoes to complete the food</p>
        <br>
        <p>Now lets follow the steps to make red enchiladas</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Let's start with the sauce:</strong> Lightly toast the chilli on a hot comal, <br> pressing them with the help of a spatula, but making sure not to <br> <strong>burn them</strong>. (This step takes only a few seconds on each side).</li><br>

            <li>Once the chilli are roasted, place them in a saucepan with water <br> and cook over low heat for <strong>15 minutes</strong>, or<strong> until soft</strong>.</li><br>

            <li>Remove the pot from the heat and let the chilli cool for 10 to 15 minutes. <br> (Remember that these should be soft and squishy).</li><br>

            <li>After the chilli have cooled, drain them and place them in the blender <br> along with the garlic cloves; Add half of cup of clean water and blend <br>until you obtain a smooth sauce. (If the sauce is very thick or the chilli <br> were not ground well, it is necessary to pass it through a fine strainer). <br> Season with oregano, salt and black pepper.</li><br>

            <li>Preheat the oven to 350F <em>(180C)</em> to keep the enchiladas warm while <br> you finish assembling.</li><br>

            <li>In a large skillet add the 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil and heat it <br> over medium heat. (Be adding the oil little by little — as necessary — <br>while frying the tortillas, since if you add it all at once the tortillas <br> will absorb it and break.)</li><br>

            <li>Dip the tortillas <em>one by one</em> into the sauce until both sides are <br> thoroughly moistened.</li><br>

            <li>Then place the tortilla in the pan with the hot oil and fry on <br> both sides. <em>(This only takes a few seconds.)</em> Place the enchilada <br> on a plate. Add more oil to the pan as needed and continue with <br> the process of frying the tortillas: first you pass them through <br> the sauce and then through the oil. Place the plate where you <br> are placing the enchiladas in the preheated oven to keep them <br> warm while you finish frying the rest of the tortillas.</li><br>

            <li>To serve the enchiladas, first place the filling of your choice in <br> the center of the tortilla and then fold or roll it.</li><br>

            <li>Sprinkle enchiladas with cheese and onion; Add any other <br> garnish to your liking, and... <strong>enjoy!</strong></li>
        </ol>
