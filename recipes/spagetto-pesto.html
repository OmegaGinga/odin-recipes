            <li><em>2L</em> of water</li><br>
            <li><em>Two</em> Spaghetti packages</li><br>
            <li><em>One</em> cup of chicken soup</li><br>
            <li><em>Four to eight</em> spinach</li><br>
            <li><em>Two</em> chard</li><br>
            <li><em>One package of</em> cream cheese</li><br>
            <li><em>500ml of</em> cream</li><br>
            <li><em>A half</em> of Butter</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Now that you have all (<strong>at least almost all</strong>) the ingredients, lets start with the preparation:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>First put to boil the water in the stove.</strong></li><br>
            <li><strong>Now put some vegetable oil in the water (just a little) and after 2 minutes add <br> the <em>spaghetti pasta</em> and lower the fire to the minimum.</strong></li><br>
            <li><strong>After 10-15 minutes (check the pasta is soft) put the pasta in another container and let it cold</strong></li><br>
            <li><strong>Lets start with the peppers, put them directly to the fire (like middle fire level) <br> until the skin is black and then remove them</strong></li><br>
            <li><strong>Put the peppers in a plastic bag with water and close it for 10 minutes.</strong></li><br>
            <li><strong>Remove the black skin of the pepper with a knife and cut them to half to <br> remove the seeds and the veins</strong></li><br>
            <li><strong>Put the peppers, cream, cheese, chicken soup, spinach to blender and fill <br> the blender with a quarter or little less of water.</strong></li><br>
            <li><strong>It's time to melt the butter in a frying pan and add the pasta and the <br> sausage we made before.</strong></li><br>
            <li><strong>After 10 minutes it will be done and you can enjoy this delicious meal.</strong></li><br>
        </ol>

        <p>Just a little observation, if you think it is too much cream then just use the cream cheese. <br> I'ts better if the sausage is middle thick and liquid because when you boil it, the volume <br> will be <strong>reduced</strong>.</p>
